			<h3>Never Change? Not really!</h3>
			<p>
				2019 - 2022 was such an amazing time of life, as I was able to be with, It was definity cut short,
				and I wish if could get some more time again to spend with you, but one thing that I learned in that time
				is that WE CHANGE.
				<br/><br/>
				Just look at you, from being afraid to read in front of our own classroom, to teach a class full of students,
				that is just CRAZY!
				<br/><br/>
				If this is change, then why stay same? Why not change more? Why not grow more? Why not take more challenges?
				Why not learn more?
				<br/><br/>
				So, Never change is such a non sense advice, I've said it earlier but hey, we do change with time, 
				even if we don't want to, right? So, what's the better advice?
				<br/><br/>
				Keep Changing, Keep Growing!
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="card card_4">
			<h3>The best of moments.</h3>
			<p>
				A lot of my life's best moments were with you, sometimes I think why? Maybe because you are so special to
				me as a sister, best friend and dearest person. Maybe that is why, even some not so good moments feel good.
				<br/><br/>
				As I said in slide 1, I wish if I had more time to spend with you, but I don't think that time may never come
				again. Right? Even if it does maybe it won't be longer than a week. So, I really want to spend every moment I get
				with you to the fullest, as that week will also keep decreasing.
				<br/><br/>
				I wish if I get to spend some great time with you again.
				<small> (but hey, you may not wish the same, and that is okay.)</small>
				Anyways, Thank you for giving these great moments and being with me always.
				<br/><br/>
				Enjoy every second of your life.
